                <h2>Plantasia — 2024.12</h2>
                <p>
                    The protagonists of the forest are not the living beings growing toward the sky but the deceased ones who have turned into nourishment, nurturing the new generation. The boundary between life and death is so blurred that the entire forest shares a unified will on its journey.
                </p>
                <p>—— Michio Hoshino</p>
                <p>
                    When I witness the clash between human power and the forces of nature, it feels like observing a battle for sovereignty. Yet, I hesitate to name the origin of this "war" as "evil." It is born of humanity’s boundless sentimentality, its hubris, and its unyielding sense of responsibility—a ceaseless yearning to carve out a more hospitable space for life. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    We forget, all too often, that we are not apart from nature but of it, and that our strength was never meant to defy it. Anthropocentrism is the offspring of our arrogance, blind to the truth that humanity is but a fleeting product of the cosmic dance—the chaos of the Big Bang transforming into the harmony of universal order.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To truly grasp the Anthropocene, we must step beyond the role of mere spectators and reenter the embrace of the natural world. Through the eyes of the First Nations, we may rediscover the sacred threads of symbiosis that weave us into the tapestry of life itself.
