            The protagonists of the forest are not the living beings growing toward the sky
but the deceased ones who have turned into nourishment, nurturing the new
generation. The boundary between life and death is so blurred that the entire
forest shares a unified will on its journey.——Michio Hoshino.
When I witness the clash between human power and the forces of nature, it feels
like observing a battle for sovereignty. Yet, I hesitate to name the origin of this
"war" as "evil." It is born of humanity’s boundless sentimentality, its hubris,
and its unyielding sense of responsibility—a ceaseless yearning to carve out a
more hospitable space for life. Thus, we strive, we take, and we defend the fragile
“home” we have crafted.
In this pursuit, we wound the very nature that sustains us, yet we endlessly
seek ways to mend, to sustain, to protect. We forget, all too often, that we are
not apart from nature but of it, and that our strength was never meant to defy
it. Anthropocentrism is the offspring of our arrogance, blind to the truth that
humanity is but a fleeting product of the cosmic dance—the chaos of the Big
Bang transforming into the harmony of universal order.
To truly grasp the Anthropocene, we must step beyond the role of mere
spectators and reenter the embrace of the natural world. Through the eyes of the
First Nations, we may rediscover the sacred threads of symbiosis that weave us
into the tapestry of life itself.
