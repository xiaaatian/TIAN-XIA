            As I compiled this portfolio, I realized that everything—objects, experiences, and even people—can be seen as consumer goods.

            I document the world from my perspective, capturing the things we consume daily, from everyday objects to symbols of status like cars. This raises a fundamental question: Do we truly own these things, or do they define us?
