           In this project, I've documented the life cycle of the construction of a man-made structure within a natural setting, from its inception to its eventual demise. This journey begins with the raw square stone, moves on to the processed building materials at the factory, then follows their transportation to the construction site for further processing, and ultimately completes in the final construction. Over time, and due to the effects of both time and human activity, some buildings gradually submerge into the water. 
This marks my initial foray into creating a New topographic photography. Upon first encountering the concept, words such as "rational," "cold," "objective," and "expressionless" left a profound impact on me. It was after witnessing the remarkable works of photographers like Robert Adams, Stephen Shore, and Bernd and Hilla Becher that I became deeply moved by the interplay between people, nature, and architecture. I don't believe I can transform everything, like restoring the equilibrium between nature and humanity. My aim is simply to stand before the world, observing and recording these man-made behemoths from a relatively objective perspective.
