            Positioning myself as an observer, I witness a process of regression—one where human creation succumbs to time and nature.

            This project documents the life cycle of a man-made structure within a natural setting, tracing its journey from raw stone to processed building materials, through construction, and ultimately, its gradual decay. The spiral structure of the building evokes an infinite cycle, mirroring the ongoing struggle between humans and nature. Over time, some structures inevitably submerge into water, revealing the impermanence of our surroundings and the delicate interplay between presence and absence.
